### Goals
The goals of this project are: 
* Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax.
* Learn to pass information between components using props.
* Learn to write readable JSX (your render methods/return statements should be clean and simple).
* Use propTypes for every component receiving props.
* Learn how to unit test React components including snapshot testing, methods, and changes in state.
* Display different categories of current news.
* Use data from an API.
