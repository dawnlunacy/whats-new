### Goals
The goals of this project are: 
* Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax.
* Learn to pass information between components using props.
* Learn to write readable JSX (your render methods/return statements should be clean and simple).
* Use propTypes for every component receiving props.
* Learn how to unit test React components including snapshot testing, methods, and changes in state.
* display different categories of current news.
* use data from an API. 

### Set Up

1. Clone down this repo.
2. `cd` into this repository and run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` to start up your React server. (A browser window should open allowing you to see the app)
